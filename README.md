## :sunglasses: The Name's Fonso :sunglasses:

Hi! Let me introduce myself, I am Alfonso Miguel Roldan, currently a 2nd Year :computer: BS Computer Science :computer: student at THE Ateneo de Manila University.

## :clipboard: About Me :clipboard:

Heyo, I am your a-typical college student who has an interest in coding but is too lazy to jumpstart any project of his own. Data Science and any Back-end Development has been a particular interest of mine ever since delving into this field but I can't say that I am experienced enough to do anything with the sort on my own. I am open to learn anything as especially if it peaks my interest!
