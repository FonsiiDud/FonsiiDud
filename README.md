Heyo, I am your a-typical college student who has an interest in coding. Data Science and any Back-end Development has been a particular interest of mine ever since delving into this field but I can't say that I am experienced enough to do anything with the sort on my own. I am open to learn anything as especially if it peaks my interest!
